Application Details:
    1. Application Name: Cognizant-Assignment-UI
    2. Package Manager: NPM (Node Package Manager)
    3. UI Technology: Angular 7
    4. Other: Material Design
    
Application Architecture:
    1. In this application, i created 2 pages
        1.1. Upload Page: Here you can upload the CSV file from your local computer as many time you want. Every time you will get the latest uploaded data.
        1.2. Result Page: Here you can view the uploaded CSV data into the tabular format. And in this page, you can also perform a filter on the records which are available into the table.
            Note: In the table, I provided the pagination also. So that you can set the number of the rows per pages.
            
    2. I added one service
        2.1. Data Service: This service is responsible for holding the processed CSV data.
            Note: I created this service because in this application there is no backend that's why we need to hold the data at UI side only.
